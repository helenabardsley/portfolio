## About Me
---
<div style="text-align: justify"> I have always been curious about why people do what they do, and why they think the way that they do. This interest was my reasoning for double majoring in Brain & Cognitive Science (B.S.) and Psychology (B.A.). During my time as an undergraduate, I was completely lost on what I wanted to do as a future career. However, one thing I was sure of was that I wanted to make a positive societal impact with my job. I took a variety of courses, ranging from statistics and mathematics, business, and even ended up minoring in Bioethics due to the philosophy classes I took, as well as was fortunate enough to be able to participate as a research assistant in two different labs. Working with statistics and data was a natural way of thinking for me, and I enjoyed this a lot. However, I wasn't sure how this could be applied to a career that I would deem as useful. In other words, I thought working with data and statistics would mean that I would be stuck in a box all day doing meaningless work. It wasn't until a couple of yeard ago, where my my parents were moving and found a box containing a mountain of data all about me. This is when I realized how transformative data can be. I found myself pouring over everything from developmental assessments to IQ tests, standardized test results to head circumference monitoring. I have always enjoyed statistics and dealing with data in my classes and research, but seeing analysis about my own development, most of it from a time I donâ€™t remember, was especially fascinating and insightful, helping me understand myself better. It was a powerful example of how data, when analyzed effectively, can help identify areas for improvement and guiding impactful decisions. The realization that data provides insight for arguably everything, including the projection of my own development, fueled my passion for data-driven research. I want to work for a company where I can contribute to meaningful, innovative solutions. Specifically, I want to make life for humans better by creating solutions where decision making and thinking is easier for us. This is why I chose to further my education to pursue my Master's of Science in Applied Analytics at Columbia University. Made this portfolio because I feel like my resume does not fully describe my experiences and what I have done...</div>

### Kaggle Competition: Predict Click-Through Rate (CTR) using Lasso, Ridge, XGBoost and LightGBM
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](Projects/PAC%20Project%20Report.html)


<div style="text-align: justify">Using R, I performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict CTR, all while not overfitting my predictive model. After testing a variety of different techniques, my best model used XGBoost and had a Residual Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.06186, and out of all of my classmates in my program, I ranked <b>37/400</b>, which is approximately <b>top 10%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>
