## About Me
---
<div style="text-align: justify"> Hi, I'm Helena, a <b>data-driven storyteller</b> who enjoys <b>visualizing complex insights</b> to reveal the bigger picture, and translating them into <b>actionable strategies.</b> </div> 
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> I realized how transformative data can be a couple of years ago, when my parents were moving and my mom unearthed a box containing a mountain of data, all about me. I found myself pouring over everything from developmental assessments to IQ tests, standardized test results to head circumference monitoring. My speech and large skull had produced years of data, while annual school district testing compared my progress to peers from both my school and across the state, using an array of visualization tools. I have always enjoyed statistics and dealing with data in my classes and research, but seeing analysis about my own development, most of it from a time I don’t remember, was especially fascinating and insightful and it has helped me understand myself better. The realization that data provides insight for arguably everything, from the projection of my own development to broader societal trends, fueled my passion for data-driven research. </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> My choice to double major in Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BS) and Psychology (BA), with a minor in Bioethics, was made to allow me to explore human decision making. Through my courses and research, I have become fascinated by how human behavior intersects with data, and this field is something I hope to combine with data analysis as a career. </div>
<br>
<center><img src="images/Graduation.jpg"/></center>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> Now, as a graduate student at Columbia University studying Applied Analytics (MS), I am learning how to combine my knowledge of human behavior with data analysis to derive meaningful insights and make accurate predictions. Beyond uncovering patterns, I love using data to look forward, to predict future trends and outcomes, and to guide decision-making. Data is such a powerful tool, not just for understanding the "how" or the "why", but also for improvement and change, with the potential to make the world a better place. My goal is to work for a company where I contribute to positive change by leveraging data insights to solve problems and shape a better future. </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> Sure, you could glance at my resume and see the technical experience and relevant work I have done, but a single page cannot fully capture my enthusiasm, excitement, and dedication to data-driven work. As you read through my portfolio, I hope you begin to understand me, and how my rather untraditional path of education makes me an excellent candidate for a data-related internship or role. </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">Currently, I am seeking <b>internships for Summer 2025</b> (or full-time positions) at a company where I can apply my skills to <b>make a difference</b>. I am excited about any oppertunity to learn, contribute, and grow through data. </div>

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](Projects/PAC%20Project%20Report.html)


<div style="text-align: justify">Using R, I performed comprehensive <b>exploratory data analysis</b> to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict CTR, all while not overfitting my predictive model. After testing a variety of different techniques, my best model used XGBoost and had a Residual Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.06186, and out of all of my classmates in my program, I ranked <b>37/400</b>, which is approximately <b>top 10%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>

[![View on Microsoft Powerpoint](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_Powerpoint-blue?logo=Powerpoint)](images/Peloton.pptx)
<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, my team and I conducted a strategic analysis of growth, retention, and market position for Peloton, investigating the factors leading to their company's decline in revenue post-COVID-19.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">I used Tableau to design dashboards and visualizations, which I combined into a comprehensive storyboard. I conducted thorough research and performed my own calculations to find and analyze data on revenue trends, customer attrition, competitive positioning, and develop strategic recommendations. These visualizations highlighted key insights, including a misalignment between Peloton’s product offerings and their shifting consumer fitness preferences since the pandemic. The customer attrition analysis revealed emerging trends in the fitness industry, such as the shift to hybrid workout models and the growing popularity of strength training, which differs from Peloton’s current focus areas like cycling and rowing.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">With my team, we presented strategic data-driven recommendations, including product diversification into strength-based programs, enhanced marketing for app-only subscriptions, and partnerships to expand Peloton’s reach. These strategies aimed to align Peloton’s offerings with consumer demands and improve long-term customer retention.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">This project deepened my expertise in using data analytics to solve complex business problems, with a strong focus on visualization, consumer behavior, and strategic decision-making. It also reinforced my passion for leveraging data to drive impactful solutions in fast-paced, consumer-focused industries.</div>

<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"><u>Quick Overview:</u> Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Peloton has seen a tremendous drop in their annual revenue. Working with a team, we leveraged <b>competitor analysis, customer analysis, </b> and <b>market insights</b> to identify growth oppertunities for Peloton in these post-pandemic times. We made an <b>interactive tableau storyboard</b> to effectively present our project. </div>

### The Impact of Live-Stream Shopping on Large Fashion Brands: A Case Study at Zara
<div style="text-align: justify"> My team and I explored live-stream shopping as a strategy for Zara, a global fashion brand known for its physical presence, but their website's user interface (UI) has been often criticized in the media for its poor usability, lack of navigational aids, and confusing layout. Inspired by the success of small businesses on TikTok Shop, we investigated if live-stream shopping could address Zara’s usability challenges and improve sales, customer engagement, and purchase volume. </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">Live-stream shopping bridges the gap between physical and digital retail, allowing customers to interact with employees from home. Additionally, humans are visual creatures, and we perceive our environment best with motion. Clearer product demonstrations through live-stream may reduce return rates, lowering CO2 emissions and packaging waste, driving sustainability. Looking ahead, live-stream shopping could enable advanced innovations like AI-powered virtual try-ons, transforming the online shopping experience. And if successful, this could position Zara as a leader in retail innovation, setting new industry standards.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">We designed a randomized experimental study with 400 U.S. based Zara customers, divided into control and live-stream intervention groups. Our key metrics were sales profit, click-through rates (CTR), and purchase volume. Using R, I conducted simulation studies based on thoroughly researched effect sizes to explore no effect and expected effect scenarios. ANOVA, two-sample t-tests, and proportion tests were applied. There were 1,000 simulations per scenario, and for each scenario, we estimated true effects, calculated confidence intervals, and assessed the likelihood of false positives and negatives. Our simulations provided valuable insights and a foundation for future implementation. With our proposed effect sizes, our findings suggest live-stream shopping could enhance customer engagement and purchasing decisions. </div>

### Multilingual Differences in Speech Perception and Word Learning
<div style="text-align: justify"> During the summer of 2023, I worked with my Principal Investigator and 3 time former professor, Dr. Yang, on a project exploring speech perception and word learning differences among multilingual participants. My primary responsibilities included fitting participants with EEG caps to monitor brain activity during speech perception tests, and <b>processed the data</b> using <b>MATLAB</b>. Specifically, I <b>filtered</b> out irrelevant signals from the EEG data to isolate relevant brain signals and identified and removed artifact-ridden epochs, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our data. Additionally, I conducted independent component analysis to separate and analyze the brain activity components further. </div>

### Investigating Visual Deficits in Schizophrenia Patients
[![View on Project Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_Website-blue?logo=Website)](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/keane)
<div style="text-align: justify">I contributed to a research project investigating the role of eye movements alone in detecting schizophrenia. Under the guidance of my Principal Investigator (PI), who hypothesized that schizophrenic patients' visual perception deficits could lead to a new schizophrenia detection methodology, we reviewed existing scientific evidence on these deficits and developed a simple visual detection task to test this hypothesis. Our study included a variety of healthy, bipolar, and schizophrenic patients, and my role was to analyze the data from their performances on a carefully designed visual detection task, and compare performances amongst groups. </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">To organize the data collected, I used <b>Python</b> to compile and preprocess all of the data into a single, structured <b>Excel</b> file. Then, using <b>R</b> for <b>statistical analysis</b>, I read in the Excel file, and conducted <b>ANOVA testing</b> to detect if there were significant differences between the three groups in timing and accuracy of the visual perception task. Additionally, I created graphical displays of the data using the <b>ggplot2</b> package in <b>R</b>. </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">At the conclusion of my time in the lab, I presented my findings to my research team and colleagues in the Neuroscience department using <b>Microsoft PowerPoint</b>. My presentation covered the study’s background, methodology, results, and their implications for future research, as well as my concerns about our current research design, and suggestions how to improve our study's robustness.</div>
<br>

<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"><u>Quick Overview:</u> Used <b>Python</b> for <b>data preprocessing</b> and <b>R</b> for <b>statistical analysis</b> and <b>data visualization</b>. Presented the study's research design, results from statistical testing, and recommendations for future research by emphasizing ways to improve the study's robustness. </div>
